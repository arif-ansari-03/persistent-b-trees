A persistent B-tree implementation using memory mapping

\* a little bit of background \*
So in my second year of college, we were taught DBMS and I was interested in actually making a DBMS. To make it efficient, I thought of using B-trees. And since then I have been on and off this project. Persistence has been one major hurdle for me while working on this project and currently at the end of third year, I find memory mapping while working on an Advanced Algorithms project. So now, I find myself back on the project, and this time using memory mapping for persistence. Since I already have a non persistent b-tree implementation, this shouldn't be very hard right?
